            <h2>Why Child Abuse Awareness Matters</h2>
            <p>Child abuse is a harsh reality that affects millions of children worldwide. It comes in various forms, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, as well as neglect. These experiences can have long-lasting and devastating effects on a child's physical and mental well-being.</p>
            <p>Child abuse awareness is not just an important cause; it's a collective responsibility. By shedding light on this issue, we can empower individuals, families, communities, and organizations to recognize the signs, take action, and work together to protect our children.</p>
